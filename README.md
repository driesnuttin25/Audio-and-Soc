The working and most up to date version of my code is the ss_and_mc (speed sensor and motor control) code. 
In this code you will find the following features
- Pwm is controllable and I can send it out to where I want and a duty cycle that I choose
- While the pwm is being sent out, the speed sensor is counting the amount of pulses that the motors producing
- This works for the Car (GPIO still needs to be put in the code to fully utilise the motor driver (forwards and backwards)
